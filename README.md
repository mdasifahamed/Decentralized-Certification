# Decentralized Certification 

This chaincode will be used across consortiums to issue digital certificates. The consortium will be formed with a parent institution that has the sole right to issue certificates. The child institutions will send requests to the smart contract stored on the ledger. Based on these requests, the parent institution will issue the certificates.
